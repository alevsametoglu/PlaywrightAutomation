# PlaywrightAutomation

This project is a test suite for automating avatar update scenarios on a website using Playwright and @playwright/test.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm should be installed on your machine.

### Installation

- Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Tests

To run the test suite, use the following command:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

### Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure to separate the page objects and test files.

- The `pages` directory contains page object classes that define the actions and elements on specific pages of the website.
- The `tests` directory contains the test files written using the @playwright/test framework.

### Configuration

The project uses the default Playwright configuration specified in the `playwright.config.js` file. You can modify the configuration according to your requirements.

### Test Files

The test files are located in the `tests` directory. They are organized based on the scenarios being tested. Each test file focuses on a specific functionality or feature.

### Page Objects

The page objects are defined in the `pages` directory. They encapsulate the functionality and elements of specific pages. These page objects are then used in the test files to interact with the website.
